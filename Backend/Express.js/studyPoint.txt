13. Basic routing and route parameters
14. Route parameters and query strings
15. Using req.params and req.query
16. Error handling basics
17. Basic error handling middleware
18. Project idea for basic level:
19. Create a simple REST API that serves static pages and handles different routes for a small application like a "To-do" app.


**** 2. Advanced Level (2-4 weeks)
Goal: Deepen your understanding of Express.js with more complex functionalities like authentication, database interaction, and advanced middleware.

1. Express Router
2. Modularizing routes using express.Router()
3. Structuring large applications with multiple route files
4. Templating engines
5. Using templating engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars
6. Database integration
7. Connecting Express.js with databases (MongoDB, MySQL)
8. Using Mongoose/Sequelize for database interactions
9. User Authentication
10. Understanding sessions and cookies
11. Implementing authentication using Passport.js/JWT
12. Securing APIs with authentication
13. Middleware advanced
14. Using third-party middleware (like body-parser, morgan, cors)
15. Writing custom middleware for logging, error handling, etc.
16. Handling file uploads
17. Using multer for handling file uploads in Express.js
18. Error handling and debugging
19. Centralized error handling with custom error middleware
20. Debugging tools (like node-inspector or logging libraries)
21. Project idea for advanced level:
22. Build a full-featured API with user authentication, JWT-based security, and database interaction (e.g., an e-commerce or blog platform).


**** 3. Pro Level (4-6 weeks)
Goal: Master Express.js with production-level skills such as optimizing performance, handling large-scale applications, and security.

1. Application architecture
2. Structuring large-scale Express.js applications (MVC architecture, service-oriented architecture)
3. Dependency injection in Express.js
4. API versioning
5. Strategies for versioning your APIs
6. Rate limiting and security
7. Implementing rate-limiting (using express-rate-limit)
8. Securing your Express app with Helmet.js (headers, CSRF protection)
9. Protecting against common attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
10. Optimization and performance
11. Optimizing Express.js apps (caching, compression with gzip, optimizing middleware)
12. Load balancing with clustering
13. Error tracking and monitoring in production (using tools like Sentry or New Relic)
14. Testing and CI/CD
15. Writing unit tests for routes and middleware (using Mocha, Chai, Jest)
16. Setting up continuous integration with tools like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or TravisCI
17. WebSocket integration
18. Real-time communication with WebSocket and Socket.io
19. Microservices with Express
20. Building and deploying Express-based microservices
21. Inter-service communication (using gRPC, message brokers like RabbitMQ)
22. Project idea for pro level:
23. Build a large-scale production-ready system (e.g., a real-time chat app or a scalable microservices-based platform with multiple services and a front-facing API).
