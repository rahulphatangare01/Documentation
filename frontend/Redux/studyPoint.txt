**** 1. Basic Level (1-2 weeks)
This level covers the foundation of Redux and helps you understand how it works with React applications.

1. Core Concepts
            1.1 What is Redux and why use it?
            1.2 Redux architecture (store, actions, reducers).
            1.3 Understanding unidirectional data flow.
            1.4 Setting up Redux in a React application.
2. Redux Store
            2.1 Creating and managing a store.
            2.2 Connecting the store to a React component using Provider.
3. Actions and Reducers
            3.1 Defining and dispatching actions.
            3.2 Creating reducers to handle actions and update the state.
4. Connecting Redux to React Components
            4.1 Using useSelector and useDispatch hooks.
            4.2 Mapping state and dispatch to props (if using class components).
            4.3 Handling simple UI state changes with Redux.

**** 2. Advanced Level (2-3 weeks)
This level focuses on enhancing your Redux knowledge with middleware, async logic, and best practices.

1. Redux Middleware
            1.1 What is middleware?
            1.2 Using Redux Thunk and Redux Saga for async actions.
            1.3 Applying custom middleware for logging, error handling, etc.
2. Async State Management
            2.1 Fetching data from APIs using redux-thunk.
            2.2 Handling loading states and errors with async actions.
3. Redux Toolkit
            3.1 Understanding and using Redux Toolkit for simpler Redux code.
            3.2 Features like createSlice, createAsyncThunk, configureStore.
            3.3 Reducing boilerplate with Redux Toolkit.
4. Complex State Management
            4.1 Handling normalized state and relationships between data.
            4.2 Immutable updates and using libraries like immer (built into Redux Toolkit).
5. DevTools
            5.1 Using Redux DevTools for debugging and time-traveling state.


**** 3. Pro Level (3-4 weeks)
This level covers performance optimization, advanced patterns, and scaling your Redux implementation.

1. Performance Optimization
            1.1 Avoiding unnecessary re-renders with useMemo and useCallback.
            1.2 Understanding and applying memoization in Redux selectors (reselect).
            1.3 Optimizing large-scale applications.
2. Advanced Patterns
            2.1 Handling complex UI flows with Redux (e.g., wizards, multi-step forms).
            2.2 Using Redux with other state management solutions like React Context.
3. Testing
            3.1 Writing unit tests for reducers, actions, and middleware.
            3.2 Integration testing with Redux-connected components.
4. Scaling Redux
            4.1 Best practices for structuring large Redux applications.
            4.2 Using feature-based folders, modularizing reducers and actions.
            4.3 Managing large state trees.
5. Real-time Data
            5.1 Integrating Redux with WebSockets or other real-time data sources.
6. Redux with TypeScript
            6.1 Strongly typing Redux actions, reducers, and state.
            6.2 Using Redux Toolkit with TypeScript.
