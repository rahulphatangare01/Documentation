 Basic Level (1-2 weeks)
At the basic level, you should focus on understanding the core fundamentals of JavaScript. These include:

1. Syntax and Basics:
            1.1 Variables (var, let, const)
            1.2 Data types (String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object)
            1.3 Operators (Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical)
            1.4 Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
            1.5 Loops (for, while, do-while)
2. Functions:
            2.1 Function declaration vs expression
            2.2 Arrow functions
3. Basic DOM Manipulation:
            3.1 Selecting elements (document.getElementById, querySelector)
            3.2 Handling events (addEventListener)
4. Basic Error Handling:
            4.1 Try-Catch blocks
            4.2 Intro to Debugging (console)

**** 2. Advanced Level (3-4 weeks)
In the advanced stage, youâ€™ll deepen your understanding of JavaScript and explore more sophisticated features:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
            1.1 Object creation and manipulation
            2.1 Prototypes and inheritance
            2.2 Classes and constructors
2. ES6+ Features:
            2.1 Destructuring
            2.2 Spread/Rest operator
            2.3 Template literals
            2.4 let, const vs var
            2.5 Arrow functions, default parameters
            2.6 Modules (import/export)
            2.7 Promises, Async/Await
3. Asynchronous JavaScript:
            3.1 Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await
            3.2 Event loop and microtasks/macrotasks
4. Functional Programming Concepts:
            4.1 Higher-order functions (map, reduce, filter)
            4.2 Closures, scope, and lexical environment
            4.3 Pure functions and immutability
5. Error Handling (Advanced):
            5.1 Custom errors
            5.2 Asynchronous error handling
6. JavaScript in the Browser:
            6.1 DOM manipulation (advanced)
            6.2  Event delegation
            6.3 Browser APIs (localStorage, sessionStorage)

**** 3. Pro Level (4-6 weeks)
The professional level involves mastering JavaScript for building real-world applications and handling complex scenarios.

1. Design Patterns:
            1.1 Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Module patterns
            1.2 MVC/MVVM architecture
2. Advanced Asynchronous Patterns:
            2.1 Async Generators, Observables
            2.2 Web Workers and Service Workers (for background tasks)
            2.3 Handling concurrency
3. Memory Management & Performance Optimization:
            3.1 Garbage collection, closures, and memory leaks
            3.2 Event-loop deep dive and performance optimization techniques
4. Deep Dive into JavaScript Engines (V8, SpiderMonkey):
            4.1 How JavaScript is executed internally
5. Event-driven and Non-blocking I/O:
            5.1 Understanding asynchronous event handling in-depth
            5.2 Node.js specific event-driven architecture
6. Modules and Tooling:
            6.1 Webpack, Babel, ESM, and CommonJS modules
7. Security:
            7.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), CORS
8. Testing in JavaScript:
            8.1 Unit testing with Jest or Mocha
            8.2 Integration and end-to-end testing
9. JavaScript Frameworks (Understanding Core Concepts):
            9.1 React, Angular, or Vue.js (choose one for in-depth learning)
10 TypeScript (Optional but highly recommended):
            10.1 Basic to advanced TypeScript for large-scale JavaScript apps
