4.  <b>What are the differences between a class component and functional component? </b>
</summary>
The class component uses ES6 class syntax, and it extends React components with a render method that returns React elements.

Functional components with hooks are purely JavaScript functions that also return React elements. Before the introduction of hooks, functional components were stateless.
